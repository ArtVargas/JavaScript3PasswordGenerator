# Password Generator
This Javascript password generator was created to include all the functionality and working applications using Javascript. In order to generate passwords with a character limit there was an inclusion of many variables which had the user select a password with uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and etc. Challenges that were faced were being able to utilize all the knowledge learned in order to use JavaScript for the first time correctly. The goal was focusing on making all the necessary code adjustments that fit the criteria in order to have the Javascript code run properly. There were issues having to remember to implement arrays, strings, and loops for variables. Knowing how to start writing certain functions for the code proved to be quite difficult, but over time it vastly improved. The main issue was working with Javascript and learning to be as specific as possible for the first time, but was rewarding nevertheless! This project stands on its own due to being a first time attempt at using Javascript and having it being able to create a fully functional password generator that met all the criteria needed for 100% functionality.
